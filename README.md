## Objetive
The purpose of undisnite is to show the content of the daily store of fortnite. In addition to showing the daily items, it also has several extra features that are not possible to know in-game. 

## My Approach
As it was my first time to develop a mobile application, I decided to choose react native first, but after a few hours I felt it wasn't what I was looking for. I discovered flutter, it totally changed my way of thinking and provided me with several other features that I wasn't getting in react native. Another thing that caught my attention was the fact that with a code it runs on iOS and Android. Simply amazing!
Therefore, the application was fully developed using flutter and obtaining data through an API dedicated 100% to fortnite.

First the application was something to be practical and elegant at the same time in order to provide an easy user experience. So I chose to focus on the main page with the important information, the main fortnite News, and their daily items. After that, I also created the item page that allows the user to check extra details that don't exist within the game.

In the next versions, the app was a little upgraded in which you could already see the animated emote inside the item page, which unfortunately never advanced to the Google Play Store.
